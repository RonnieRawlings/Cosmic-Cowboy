# Prefabs #

This is where you create your prefabs.
Make sure you turn anything that is used in more than one scene or multiple times in a scene as a prefab!
We also recomend getting into the habit of editing prefabs in the prefab editor (double click the prefab) rather than editing it in the scene.
